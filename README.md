This project delves into the realm of medical imaging and biometric data analysis, focusing on feature extraction, enhancement, and classification. The objective is to leverage datasets available on Kaggle, applying various image processing techniques to extract meaningful features, enhance image quality, and ultimately classify the data using suggested classifiers.

Part 1: Dataset Selection and Preprocessing:

Dataset Selection:
Students create an account on Kaggle and select a dataset related to medical imaging or biometric images.
Preprocessing:
Preprocess the selected dataset, including tasks such as resizing images to a uniform size, normalization, noise removal, and any specific preprocessing steps relevant to medical imaging or biometric data.

Part 2: Image Enhancement and Feature Extraction:

Feature Extraction Techniques:
Implement feature extraction using at least three methods suitable for medical or biometric image analysis, such as LBP, HOG, and SIFT.
Each team member focuses on one technique to ensure balanced participation.
Pretrained Models for Feature Extraction:
Explore and implement feature extraction using pretrained deep learning models such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception.
Image Enhancement:
Apply at least two different image enhancement techniques, such as histogram equalization, noise reduction, or sharpening filters.
Comparative Analysis:
Analyze how feature extraction results vary before and after image enhancement.

Part 3: Classification and Analysis:

Classification Model Implementation:
Implement classification using suggested classifiers such as SVM, Random Forest, or neural networks.
Ensemble Techniques (Bonus):
Optionally, combine different feature extraction techniques using ensemble methods like stacking or voting classifiers.
Evaluation and Comparative Analysis:
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the classification models.
